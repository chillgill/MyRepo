    The Iconfinder API 2.0 offers both a public and a private part of the API. The public part includes the basic functionality, one would experience as a user of Iconfinder without being logged in. The private part of the API includes access to user information, purchases etc. depending on the authorization scope.
    
    There are currently two ways to authenticate. Using a JSON Web Token or using authorization code. Using the web token will allow you to hide the API access from your users - this will require that your account is on an API subscription plan. The authorization code approach lets your users authenticate using their own Iconfinder accounts.
    
    In order to use OAuth 2.0, you need to [register an API application](https://www.iconfinder.com/account/applications), which will be assigned a unique client ID and client secret.
    
    Once you have registered your application, you need to authorize users to be able to access the Iconfinder API version 2.0 as the specific user. The authorization flow between your application and Iconfinder depends on the type of application youâ€™re developing.
    
    > It is very important that the client secret is not shared with anyone. When developing an application that uses OAuth 2.0 you should also make sure to use a strong, unique password for your Iconfinder account.
