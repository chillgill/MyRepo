content: |
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard way of representing security claims between your application and Iconfinder API. A JWT token is simply a signed JSON object which contains information which enables the receiver to authenticate the sender of the request. For more documentation about JWT, see the [JWT documentation](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
    
    Based on an example of a JavaScript based application that makes requests to the Iconfinder API, the sequence diagram will be following:

    Generate token server-side
    
    Requesting a new token requires a server-side script that uses the client ID and secret. We have created snippets that can be used as a foundation for your implementation:
    
    - PHP example code can be found on https://github.com/iconfinder/api-demo/tree/gh-pages/php-server
    - Node.js project can be found here: https://github.com/iconfinder/api-demo/tree/gh-pages/node-server
    - Python example code can be found on https://github.com/iconfinder/api-demo/tree/gh-pages/python-server
    
    Getting a client ID and secret
    
    To generate new tokens you need client ID and secret. You can get these [by creating a new API application](https://www.iconfinder.com/account/applications).
